# Voron0-SSOL_toolhead
Vzero Toolhead Design 

This Design Based on the https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Mini-AfterSherpa 
(Many parts are the same, mostly compatible with each other, with some modifications.)

Supports 
V0 / V0.1 
MGN9C MOD (Need Changed X_carrage)
Klicky https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe
FANsaver https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/jappaj/FanSaver

# Surpport  Hotend 

V6 DUCT = V6 / REVO SIX /  NFZone V6 / Trianglelab,Mellow V6 / Slice Copperhead(groove) / Phaetus BMO 

Micro Duct = V6Micro(threaded) / REVO micro 

Dragon Duct = Trianglelab(Phaetus) Dragon / DragonFly BMO 

Mosquito Duct = Slices Mosquito / NFCrazy 



Most recommended V6+CHC(trianglelab) Or NFZone+CHC is BEST .

Not recommend Mosquito,NFCrazy (It can kill a blowerfan. heatsink structure is Near to 3010blowerFAN.)



# Surpport Hotend
Duct A and duct B are not compatible.
(B ducts are not fitted with Orbiter. )

A DCUT (USED Big Gear , New Extruder !!)

LDO Orbiter V2.0

Bontech LGX Lite


B DUCT (can use before BMG(MiniAB) gears.)

Sailfin

I made some changes to the sailfin extruder design.
Change gear alignment
Change bolt, insertnut position
Change shaft to bolt,insertnut
(If you are changing from an existing miniAB, there is no shaft.)
Use PC4-M6 (option)
(Have you ever experienced the Teflontube coming off when insert filament? I always modify tubefittings on all extruders.
